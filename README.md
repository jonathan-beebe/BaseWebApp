Description
===========

A collection of scripts and tools I use when developing web apps.

Usage
=====

You probably won't find much use for this project out-of-the-box. It's really
a project to store tools 'n scripts 'n snippets I find useful in almost every
web-app I create. It's very useful as a reference. It can be useful as a
starting point.
